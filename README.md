User Story:
As a player of this game, you would expect to be guided through the experience and be given just enough information to know what to do but not give it away/spoil the experience.
You want it to feel like an adventure and like you don't know what will happen next. I also want to be told what todo so I can win the game.
The buttons and layout should feel intuitive.
