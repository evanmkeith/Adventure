# Adventure

## Concept:
Explain the concept of the application or game. Include instructions and how to win/lose.
Thw objective of the game is to firts locate the treasure map, nativgate through the jungle to find the treasure, defeat your enemy, and then return with what you were looking for. You have 30 seconds to do this or else you need to start over. 

The initial step is to click on the area where you think the mao is located. If there, it will reveal itself to you and you then need to click on it again. 

After that, you then need to navigate through the jungle using the arrow keys on the keyboard. There are snakes that can take your life - you have three. Once you find them, you will have to defend yourself against your enemies by clicking on the button to do so. If you don't, they will take your life and you will need to start again. 

Once you've completed that, you will have won the game and go through the last part of the story.

User Story:
As a player of this game, you would expect to be guided through the experience and be given just enough information to know what to do but not give it away/spoil the experience.
You want it to feel like an adventure and like you don't know what will happen next. I also want to be told what todo so I can win the game.
The buttons and layout should feel intuitive.
